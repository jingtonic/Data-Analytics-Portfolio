# Web-Scraping-and-Using-API

In this repository, you'll find three assignments I completed, all focused on gathering info from the web.

In assignment 1, I used the Marvel API to pull out some cool data.

In assignment 2, I used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scoop up job details from LinkedIn.

And in assignment 3, I worked with Selenium again to scrape info from Wallapop.

These tasks demonstrate my skills in using APIs and web scraping tools to get the data we need.
